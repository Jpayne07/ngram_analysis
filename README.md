# nGraham Cracker

Initialized on 3/17 üçÄ --- this app is in progress and is meant to be a lightweight application usable for expert SEO technicians.

## Who Can Use this App?
Anyone!

While I first stumbled upon the nGram years ago as an SEO, the nGram can be used by anyone who calls themselves a data junkie!

## What this App Does
This app is useful to paint a large brush across a large set of data. It gives approximations as to the most frequent phrases with the highest weight.

It can be used for **keyword research**, **word clouds**, and more!

If you're looking to understand which phrases show up the most frequently in your data, you've come to the right place!

### Technologies
This app is built with a React + JS frontend and a Flask SQL Alchemy backend.
